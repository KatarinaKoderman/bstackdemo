# BstackDemo
In this mini project, **Robot Framework** is used.
For learning purposes, a robot is created. *Given* username and password, the robot opens browser and logs in. *When* it selects item, which are predefined, actual selecting items is performed. *Then* it goes to checkout, downloads receipt and logs out. 
If we really want to purchase selected items, downloaded receipt should be paid. (: Beware: it is **only a demo**!)

I would like to thank Milan for his mentorship.
